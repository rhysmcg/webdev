        <h2>Massage Gun</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Massage guns, which are also called percussion massagers, are handheld devices that use vibration and deep oscillation to
             massage irritated muscles.
            <br> 
            <br>
            Benefits of Massage Guns
            <br>
            <br>
            Reducing lactic acid buildup that causes muscle soreness. Improving flexibility. Improving lymphatic flow, which helps to rid
            your body of toxins and support your immune system. Improving body awareness by promoting mind-muscle connections that may 
            improve athletic performance.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Preliminary research shows that there is substancial amount of benefits to using massage guns such as improved range of motion,
            decreased subjective pain levels, and improved recovery time. Typical vibration massagers aren't usually powerful enough to 
            massage deeply. Massage guns—also called percussive massagers—have more powerful motors and reach deeper into muscle tissue, 
            which can relieve pain, release tension, and even improve range of motion much quicker than normal.

        <p>What is a compression boot? Compression boots are inflatable sleeves for the legs that fill with air and squeeze your 
            legs to increase blood flow. Your doctor will advise you on how long and how often to wear the compression boots 
            <br>
            <br>
            Studies show that compression boots like Normatec boots have been shown to lessen pain by increasingclearance of blood 
            lactate and circulation, and help heal injuries such as plantar fasciitis, ankle sprains, knee pain, and arthritis pain, 
            sore hips, and lower back pain.Over the course of the session, the boots feel like a deep pressure massage over the leg. 
            The graduated pressure is soothing, relaxing and calming. Its not until you take the boots off that you experience the 
            light weightless feeling through the legs
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
             How Long Should You Use Recovery Boots For? Most recovery boots come standard with duration settings of 10, 20, and 30 minutes.
             Use these depending on the intensity of your training, race, or event. To recover from a long, backbreaking workout, for 
             example, you'll want to use the boots for at least 20 or 30 minutes.

        <h2>Mini Gun</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            A mini massage gun is exactly what it sounds like, a miniature version of a full-scale 
            massage gun, that many brands create in order to give consumers a portable, lighter and 
            smaller option. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Regular-sized massage guns are bulky and can be quite heavy, as is the case 
            with the Theragun PRO and Elite. Both are high-power guns with a lot of force and capability,
            but they’re large and can be difficult to hold if you have limited ability. They would also 
            be difficult to use in a high-pressure, action-oriented situation, like on a ski slope or in
            the middle of a foot race.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Theragun Mini, on the other hand, is clearly designed to be easy to use anywhere, 
            including in both of those scenarios. Mini massage guns tend to have fewer speeds than 
            larger guns, smaller massage gun heads and fewer controls. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The nature of their stripped-down 
            designs makes them easier to use, hold and operate. What you gain in convenience you do lose 
            in power, as you can’t massage a large muscle like your quad with a mini massage gun as you 
            can a larger model, but for the right situations they’re more than worth it.
            <br>

        <h2>Electric Shock Pads</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Whether you’re recovering from an injury or stroke or dealing with the pain of fibromyalgia 
            or another condition, you may benefit from a physical therapy procedure called electrical 
            stimulation, or e-stim. 
            <br>
            <br>
            E-stim sends mild electrical pulses through the skin to help 
            stimulate injured muscles or manipulate nerves to reduce pain. E-stim may not be appropriate
            for everyone, but for many people this painless procedure is accelerating recovery and 
            providing relief from painful or uncomfortable symptoms.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            E-stim uses small electrodes placed on the skin. The electrodes are small, sticky pads that 
            should come off with little discomfort at the end of the session. Several electrodes are 
            placed around the area receiving treatment. Wires from the e-stim device are attached to the 
            pads. Steady streams of electrical pulses are delivered through the wires from the e-stim 
            unit. The unit may be small enough to fit in your hand or larger, like a landline phone and
            answering machine. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For muscular stimulation, the pulses will reach the muscles, signaling 
            them to contract. Pulses aimed at the nervous system block the transmission of pain signals 
            from reaching the spinal cord and brain. The pulses also stimulate the body to produce more 
            natural pain-relieving chemicals called endorphins.
            <br>

        <h2>Electric Suctional Cup</h2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            Cupping is an alternative therapy that uses suction cups to stimulate your skin and muscles. 
            It can be done on your face or body. The suction promotes increased blood circulation, which 
            may help relieve muscle tension, promote cell repair, and aid in other regeneration.

            3 Main Advantages of this Product
            <br>
            <br>
            1.The cupping massager adds modern technology to the traditional cupping device, adding 
            vibrating sticks and red light physiotherapy functions, which can absorb and release 
            rhythmically. Compared with the traditional cupping device, no open flame is needed, 
            it is convenient to carry and clean, and it can massage better and bring a more comfortable 
            experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            2.The product has three negative pressure modes and three vibration modes. Different 
            combinations of modes can give you different massage experiences. Left click to start 
            and select negative pressure mode, right click to select vibration mode, its operation 
            is so simple! You can choose the most suitable mode according to your own situation!
            <br>
            <br>
            3.Red light therapy can promote blood circulation, relieve fatigue and pain, enhance 
            immunity and metabolism, and bring you more relaxation and pleasure.
